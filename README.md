# Overview

You're working on an NFT ticketing platform built with Node.js microservices and MongoDB. After a user purchases a ticket, an NFT is minted and airdropped to their wallet. However, the airdrop process is prone to failures due to various blockchain-related issues. Your task is to implement a queue-based job processor system that handles retries for failed airdrops.

## Assumptions

An external scheduler will ping the `/jobs/airdrop/retry` endpoint every minute.

## Objectives

1. API Endpoint:

   - Implement a POST endpoint `/jobs/airdrop/retry` that triggers the retry process.
   - The endpoint should process up to 20 failed airdrops per invocation.

2. Data Schema Design:

   - Design and implement a MongoDB schema for storing airdrop information.

3. Retry Logic:

   - Implement a retry mechanism.
   - Define the maximum number of retry attempts before marking an airdrop as permanently failed.

4. Mock Airdrop Function:

   - Create a mock function that simulates the airdrop process with the following characteristics:
     - 80% success rate
     - Random completion time between 1-70 seconds
     - Throws an error if execution time exceeds 60 seconds

5. Error Handling:

   - Develop comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.

6. Testing:
   - Write unit tests using Jest for core components of your system.
   - Include a test case to handle unexpected duplicate triggers of the retry process.

## Requirements

1. Use Node.js (latest LTS version) and Express.js for the API.
2. Use TypeScript (latest stable version) with ES6 features.
3. Use mongodb-memory-server for in-memory MongoDB data storage.
4. Implement proper concurrency control to handle multiple simultaneous requests.
5. Include appropriate error handling and logging.
6. Write unit tests using Jest.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: The application should meet all outlined objectives.
- **System Design**: Practicality and simplicity in the overall system architecture, with particular attention to code modularization for different components.
- **Code Quality**: Cleanliness, readability, and inline documentation.
- **Modularity and Scalability**: Effective use of modular design patterns to enhance code scalability and maintainability.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage and quality of unit tests.
- **Error Handling**: Robustness in handling various error scenarios.
- **Concurrency Control**: Effectiveness in managing multiple simultaneous requests.
